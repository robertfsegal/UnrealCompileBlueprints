# UnrealCompileBlueprints
Blueprint function library to allow compilation of all blueprints in a project

This is an extension of the compile blueprint exploration I've explored on my blog some months ago.  Unreal Engine offers no way to compile all blueprints integrated into the editor but they do offer a "commandlet" to do this which can be run on command line.  More exploration of how the commandlets are used can be found on my [blog](http://sarcasticcoder.com/unrealengine/compiling-all-project-blueprints-in-unreal-engine/)
